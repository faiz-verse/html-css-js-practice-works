# HTML, CSS, JS Practice works

These are my html,css & js practice works that are inside the practice folder <br>
I did these practices along ago so they are beginner level timepass works ðŸ˜† <br>
Most of them are not responsive as they are done only for practice so suggested to open via Desktop ðŸ’»ðŸ˜… <br>
