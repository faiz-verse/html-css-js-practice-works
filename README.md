# HTML, CSS & JavaScript Practice Works  

This repository contains my **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** practice projects, all stored inside the **practice folder**.  
These were created a while ago, so they are mostly **beginner-level experiments**—just some fun practice! 😆  

## ⚠️ Note  
- Most of these projects **aren't responsive**, as they were made purely for practice.  
- **Recommended:** Open them on a **desktop** 💻 for the best experience.
